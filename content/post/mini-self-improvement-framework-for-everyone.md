Hi! How are you? 

I like a quote Hafeez from The Roommates always says. Though i modified it so now it's my quote. It says,

> Improve yourself physically, spiritually, emotionally, mentally and financially.

I won't waste your time and I'll get right into it.

### Physically

1. Get fit
2. Do Intermittent Fasting
3. Start sprinting once a week
4. Eat real food: Veggies, Meat, and Eggs. Skip Refined, Minimize Starchy, and Eat Fibrous Carbs. Switch Canola/Sunflower Oil to Butter(Cow), Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, or Coconut Oil. Cholesterol is a building block for your body. This is especially true for men.
5. Sleep 7 + hours
6. Do OMAD(One Meal A Day) or OAAHMD(One And A Half Meals A Day)

4. Do something creative a day
5. Write a journal/diary
6. Schedule alone time where it's just you and your thoughts(don't be afraid of boredom, it's where you'll find your best ideas.)
7. Do some visualization. Visualize the best version of yourself. Put in challenges you expect to come against and find their solutions.

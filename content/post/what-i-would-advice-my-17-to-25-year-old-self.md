Hi 18 year old me and all the other 18-year-olds. I hope you read this adopting a growth mindset and learn from my failures/successes. 

I'll keep it short but sweet and simple.

 1. Make lots of friends
 2. Go out and hang out with them
 3. Find something you are good at and commit
 4. Foster relationships with your family
 5. Don't be afraid to have fun
 6. Find people who can help you financially, emotionally, and mentally
 7. Maintain a clear distinction between fun friends and good friends, one will help you unwind and enjoy life, the other will grow with you and help you become better than you are today. Both serve different purposes.
 8. Set aside serious time, study, learn how to cook, clean, learn life skills, grow!
 9. Read more books
10. Don't be afraid to venture out of the field you have chosen. Some knowledge in psychology will be helpful and that book about anatomy that you love so much will contribute to your future, what about that book on how engines work, that will be good too.
11. Don't stay indoors for too long
12. Be kind
13. Treat the janitor like a friend or a CEO
14. GIVE!
15. Find ways to increase your knowledge of the world. Attend seminars and more.
16. Find a hobby or several
17. Take responsibility for your life
18. Maintain your body
19. Write! Create a personal blog and write something
20. Have fun!

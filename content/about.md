#### Get in Touch

1. **üê¶** [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/stephenajulu) - If you've got a short question or message (<280 characters), please tweet [@StephenAjulu](https://twitter.com/stephenajulu) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I also occasionally reply to [Instagram DMs](https://instagram.com/stephenajulu) but it's much more cumbersome to do so (for now).
2. **üì®** [**Email**](mailto:alunje73@gmail.com) - If it's a longer thing, or you don't want it to be a public tweet, please email me (ajulu@stephenajulu.com). I read 100% of emails but there's only enough time in the day to reply to around 30%. If you reply to my [weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.stephenajulu.com/) with a specific question, the chances I'll reply are much higher, as I like to spend Sundays doing chill stuff like replying to emails.
3. [**Contact Page**](/contact) - I aim to reply to these as fast as possible, feel free to contact me here if you would like to guest post, advertise, share an opinion, submit a tip, sponsor a post, report a bug, want to redesign this site, have legal issues with this blog among others.
